                <p>
                    While developing Marketier – our platform for marketing and productivity tools –
                    we needed a way to quickly create forms and inputs for the tools we were building.
                    We built our own UI library to have a unique yet familiar look combined with a feature rich experience.<br><br>

                    The definate goal of this projekt is to create a <b>modern</b>, <b>jank-free</b> and <b>user-friendly</b>
                    UI library with the focus on interactive input components.
